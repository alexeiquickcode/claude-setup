Initiate code-reviewer subagent to review the **entire repository**.

Scope: Scan the full project structure and review all code files. Focus on:
- Overall architecture and mono-repo structure
- Cross-module dependencies and boundaries
- Codebase-wide patterns and consistency
- Security posture across all files

This is for comprehensive audits, not pre-commit checks.
